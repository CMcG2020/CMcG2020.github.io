description: Find and report technical debt, duplicated code, and cleanup opportunities
---

Scan the codebase for technical debt:

1. Look for duplicated code patterns across components
2. Find unused imports, variables, or components
3. Check for inconsistent styling (hardcoded values instead of CSS variables)
4. Identify components that could be refactored or simplified
5. Look for TODO/FIXME comments

Report findings as a prioritized list. Don't fix anything - just report what you find.
