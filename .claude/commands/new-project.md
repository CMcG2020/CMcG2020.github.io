description: Create a new portfolio project entry
---

Create a new project in `src/content/projects/`. Ask me for:
- Title
- Description
- Category (Development, Apps, or Writing)
- Whether it should be featured on the homepage
- Any tags
- Any external links (GitHub, live site, etc.)

Use this template:
```markdown
---
title: ""
description: ""
category: ""
date: YYYY-MM-DD
featured: false
tags: []
links: []
---

Content here...
```

After creating, run `npm run build` to verify the frontmatter is valid.
