description: Create a new blog post
---

Create a new blog post in `src/content/blog/`. Ask me for:
- Title
- Excerpt (1-2 sentences for preview)
- Category
- Any tags

Use this template:
```markdown
---
title: ""
excerpt: ""
category: ""
date: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: []
---

Content here...
```

After creating, run `npm run build` to verify the frontmatter is valid.
