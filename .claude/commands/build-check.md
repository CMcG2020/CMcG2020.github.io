Run the build and verify everything works:

1. Run `npm run build`
2. If there are errors, fix them and re-run until the build passes
3. Run `npm run preview` in the background
4. Report the results - whether the build succeeded and any issues found

After fixing any issues, update the Learnings Log in CLAUDE.md with what went wrong.
